                            Are you really offering unlimited Digital Marketing at a flat fee?
                            <p>That’s right! Our flat fee gets you access to our pool of Digital Marketing agents, managed by a Project Manager, dedicated to you. <br>
                            You’re free to assign as much tasks as you want, but the number of simultaneous jobs taken up is based on your subscription tier.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li class="faq-item">
                            What exactly does ‘unlimited digital marketing’ cover?
                            <p>When we say “unlimited digital marketing”, we mean that you are free to make as many requests as you want, and we will work through them as quickly as possible. There are no limits on how many tasks you can make in a month.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li class="faq-item">
                            How exactly does it work?
                            <p>When you subscribe, one of our managers will be in touch within 1 business day. You will be given access to your own Trello board where you can create tasks for all the things you want done. There is no limit to the number of tasks you can create, however the number of tasks that can be taken up at any one time is determined by your subscription plan.</p>
                        </li>

                            Who works my brand? Can I get a dedicated resource?
                            <p>We have a team of Digital Marketing managers overseen by a Project Manager specially assigned to you. When you make a request, your Project Manager will assign the task to the agent best suited to complete it. Once complete, we will move on to your next task. <br>
                            The Project Manager you interact with will always be the same person, dedicated to you, so that they can become more familiar with your brands, needs and working style as time goes on.</p>

                        <li class="faq-item">
                            What if I need to contact you to change or clarify a request?
                            <p>You will be able to communicate with your dedicated Project Manager through your personal Trello board. All communication that takes place must happen via the Trello board for transparency and to ensure all requests are properly noted down.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li class="faq-item">
                            How long will tasks take to complete?
                            <p>It depends on what tasks were given to us, our project manager would list the completion time in advance to the task being done. We have also included a guideline on the time required for some of the more common tasks. If you need tasks to be completed faster, you can simply add more subscriptions.</p>

                        <li class="faq-item">
                            Do you offer a free trial?
                            <p>Yes we do. All subscription plans come with a 7 day free trial during which your card will not be charged. If you change your mind, you can simply cancel your subscription before the trial period is over.</p>

                            Can I really cancel my subscription at any time?
                            <p>Absolutely! If for any reason, you are unhappy with your service, or want to cancel, you can simply login to the customer portal and cancel your subscription from there. <br>
                                Once you cancel, you will still be able to use the remaining days of your subscription that you have paid for.</p>

                        <li class="faq-item">
                            How can I cancel or change my subscription plan?

                            What if I cancel my subscription midway through the month? Will I get a partial refund?
                            <p>Subscription cancellations will take place at the end of your current billing cycle. You will still be able to make use of Agencylancer until your current billed month is over, and will not be charged for the following month. Therefore, no refunds are issued for subscription cancellations.</p>

                            What happens if I upgrade my subscription mid way?
                            <p>You will be charged immediately for the new subscription price and your billing cycle will be updated to reflect the new price and date. There is no pro-ration of the subscription price.</p>
